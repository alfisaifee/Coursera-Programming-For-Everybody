# Coursera-Python-For-Everybody
This Specialization introduces fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. 

There are 5 courses in this specialization:

1) Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python):
   This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python and the basics of how one constructs a                program from a series of simple instructions in Python.

2) Python Data Structures:
   This course introduces the core data structures of the Python programming language and the basics of procedural programming and teaches    how to use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. 

3) Using Python to Access Web Data:
   This course shows how one can treat the Internet as a source of data and scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using
   web APIs and work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python.

4) Using Databases with Python:
   This course introduce the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a    multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort. The course will use SQLite3 as its database.

5) Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python:


This specislization teaches the following:

1) Create your own applications for data retrieval and processing
2) Explain the basics of programming computers using Python
3) Describe the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) and database design
4) Understand fundamental programming concepts such as data structures

My Graded Assignments have been included in the my_code folder for respective course.
